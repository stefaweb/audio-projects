# Valve-Solid-State-Driver

Under development.

This board will allow you to drive power tubes like the 300B or the 2A3.

The only components needed to make a single-ended valve amplifier are the solid-state driver board, the power tubes, the RK- resistors and capacitors, an AC-DC power supply for the heater, the HV AC-DC power supply and the output transformers.

Here's what it should look like. You have a stereo input via two RCA jacks on one side. On the other side, two connectors for each channel, with one pad for B+, one for the tube grid, one for the negative BIAS (optional), and one for GND.

A central connector under the PCB allows you to connect an external stereo potentiometer (optional).

The middle two-pad connector allows you to connect the transformer output to create a negative feedback (optional).

There are also two jumpers on the board: one to enable or disable the negative BIAS, and another to bypass the filtering capacity at the circuit's input if you don't need DC protection.

Size: 55x90mm
