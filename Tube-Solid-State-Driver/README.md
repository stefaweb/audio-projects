# Tube-Solid-State-Driver

This board allow you to drive power tubes like the 300B or the 2A3 (or others tubes with few modifications).

The only components needed to make a single-ended Tube amplifier are the solid-state driver board, the power tubes, the RK- resistors and capacitors, an AC-DC power supply for the heater, the HV AC-DC power supply and the output transformers.

Here's what it look like. You have a stereo input via two RCA jacks on one side. On the other side, two connectors for each channel, with one pad for B+, one for the tube grid, one for the negative BIAS (optional), and one for GND.

A central connector under the PCB allows you to connect an external stereo potentiometer (optional).

The middle two-pad connector allows you to connect the transformer output to create a negative feedback (optional).

There are also two jumpers on the board: one to enable or disable the negative BIAS, and another to bypass the filtering capacity at the circuit's input if you don't need DC protection.

The manufacturing files are available on my Github repository in the file Tube-SolidState-Driver-production-1.0.1.zip.

For those who would like to build the board, you can find the Gerber files in the zip file, as well as the BOM and position files, allowing you to manufacture the PCB assembly and SMD components directly at JLPC or another company that offers the same service.
